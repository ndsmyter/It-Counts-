# Count Experiment

## Build an debug APK

Using Gradle, choose
> CountExperiment > Tasks > build > assembleDebug

or

> CountExperiment > Tasks > build > assembleRelease

If you do this, the generated APKs will be stored in
CountExperiment\mobile\build\outputs\apk.

In most cases mobile-debug.apk is the one you need.
To install it, you should make sure that there is no other application with the same path was installed.

To build using Gradle, open the Gradle view. By default this view is located in the upper right corner of Android Studio.
In the bar, the view is named "Gradle".
